# BRIDGE - Bridge Ontology
*This repo has been moved from the original wisib server to github*

The Bridge Ontology (BRIDGE) allows the classification of bridge constructions as well as their further description using data properties.

The namespace for BRIDGE terms is `https://w3id.org/bridge#`

The suggested prefix for the BRIDGE namespace is `bridge`

It is recommended to use BRIDGE together with the Bridge Topology Ontology (BROT), since no bridge components or zones are defined in BRIDGE.
