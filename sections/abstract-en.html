<h2>Abstract</h2>
  <span>The Bridge Ontology (BRIDGE) allows the classification of bridge constructions as well as their further description using data properties.</span>
  <span>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    The namespace for BRIDGE terms is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">https://wisib.de/ontologie/bridge#</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    The suggested prefix for the BRIDGE namespace is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">bridge</span>
  </p>
  <span class="markdown">It is recommended to use BRIDGE together with the Bridge Topology Ontology (<a href="https://wisib.de/ontologie/brot/">BROT</a>), since no bridge components or zones are defined in BRIDGE.</span>
